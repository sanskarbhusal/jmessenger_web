It's obviously one the ways to become software engineer, but do remember that there are programmers in the industry that have nothing to do with engineering. So, I guess, it depends on what level of a computer wizard you want to become. Obviously, computer engineers have dynamic knowledge, but they get that by sacrificing specialization. I see computer engineers through 'Jack of all, master of none' analogy. Why? because they study every freakin' thing about a computer, and on doing that specialization is sacrificed. They never get to learn anything deeply enough to be hired. No wonder most end up unemployed and few as a dish washer in restaurants draining years of learning into the sink ðŸ˜†.",
